# Advanced Giru Bot

This repository contains an **advanced, full-featured** version of the original `giru.py` for getting volume profilst. Building on the MVP, this iteration adds robust error handling, a modern OpenAI client integration, and a dual-mode ‚Äúpersona‚Äù interface so the bot only speaks when invoked.
